# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Project-Excel
My First Project, Applying New Skills, I gained in Excel

In this project, I began by exploring a coffee shop dataset, checking the data for quality, and adding new date and time fields, noted in orange to stand out, and prepare it for analysis. Next, I used Excel PivotTables to ingest the data, note trends over time and across different products. Finally, I brought everything together by creating interactive visualizations with Pivot Charts, designing a dashboard with a user interface, recommending several business changes to help the coffee shop improve its operations.

Files Contained in the Repository:

      Cleaned_and_Transformed_Dataset.xlsx
      Dashboard.xlsx
      Pivot_Table_and_Chart_Files.xlsx
      Presentation_Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Project-Excel.pptx
      README.md
      Written_Report.docx

We can tell from the charts and graphs that coffee is by far the most sold item by category. This makes sense considering the hours when transactions occur in greatest quantity. It is advised after considering the data to perhaps reestablish the operating hours of the stores to a time when the cost of staying open is justified by the revenue the store is generating. Closing the store after 6:00 PM may be beneficial to the net store revenue at the end of the day.
